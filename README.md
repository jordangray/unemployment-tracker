# Unemployment tracker
## Compare and contrast unemployment rates using different metrics

This project will allow people to experiment with different ways of calculating the US unemployment rate. Some common metrics will be provided, but users will have the option of customising this by:

1. deciding who counts as *unemployed*; and
2. deciding who is considered to be part of the US *labour force*.

The results will be interpreted graphically as an unemployment rate over time. Data will be sourced from the BLS via the FRED API.
